# Defining Problem
Adright produces different kinds of treadmills and needs to know what type of customer buys a given type of treadmill

# Solution
Perform EDA. We will use the power of visualization plots in seaborn to show the characteristics of the different customers.

# Outcome
There are subtle differences that would require advanced methods such as ANOVA to be able to tell the significance of the differences.

However based on a simple EDA analysis we can conclude that;

The people buying TM195 AND TM498 have quite similar profiles. They are partnered individuals of either gender with an education level of 14 or 16. Fitness level of 3 and an income of 50000 on average and mileage of 90 on average.

The people buying TM798 are partnered male individuals with high income who expect to use the product more and are in excellent shape.
